//! Spawning and timers, chosen per target.
//!
//! The client asks a runtime for three things: run a task in the background,
//! sleep, and put a deadline on a future. Natively all three are tokio's.
//!
//! In a browser none of them are. Tokio's timer is not implemented for
//! `wasm32-unknown-unknown` — tokio's own suite marks `Instant::now()`, and
//! even *building* a current-thread runtime with the `time` feature enabled,
//! `#[should_panic]` there — and its multi-threaded scheduler has no threads to
//! run on. Enabling tokio's `time` for wasm would therefore produce a library
//! that links and then panics on the first runtime it constructs.
//!
//! What a page does have is an event loop, and `webbluetooth-wasm` already
//! speaks to it. [`exec::spawn`](webbluetooth_wasm::exec::spawn) polls a task
//! whenever something wakes it, and the shim's `SET_TIMEOUT` operation is
//! `setTimeout` reached over the same request/settle path as every BLE call.
//! Both are already linked into a wasm build of this crate, so routing onto
//! them costs no new dependency.
//!
//! The two implementations present the same three functions, so the call sites
//! in [`crate::muse_client`] read identically on either target.
