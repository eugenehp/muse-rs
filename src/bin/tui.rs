//! Entry point for the `tui` binary.

//! The body of it lives in `src/tui.rs`; see the note in `src/main.rs` for why
//! it is a module behind a `cfg` rather than being this file. A full-screen
//! terminal UI has even less to do in a browser than the CLI does, and
//! `crossterm` has no `wasm32-unknown-unknown` backend to build against —
//! which is why `Cargo.toml` gates it by target as well as by feature.
